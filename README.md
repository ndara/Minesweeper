# Minesweeper
This is my implementation (work in progress) of the very popular game of Minesweeper.

Open the source code, and run the main program to get started.
Clicking on a square reveals how many bombs are in contact with the square. Clicking on a bomb will end the game.

TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
1. Install git on to your computer.
2. Clone this repository onto your computer (using git clone <repository_link>)
3. Open the src code folder.
4. Run Main.java with Java
5. Enjoy the game!
